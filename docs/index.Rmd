Food waste is a problem that is both environmental and economic in nature. 
Industrial levels of agricultural production have been a boon to ensuring relatively high and consistent supplies of food in much of the world, yet mis-
matches between supply and demand related to pricing, geopolitical conditions, 
and other issues lead to situations where resource-intensive processes involved 
in producing a robust food supply are conducted in vain. By implementing market
incentives like tax credits and subsidies for producers to generate supplies
that match demand, implementing public messaging campaigns, and providing a
mechanism for surplus food to be matched with people who can least afford it,
units of government can meaningfully combat food waste.
